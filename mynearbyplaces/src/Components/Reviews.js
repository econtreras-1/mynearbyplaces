        review: "We got take out from this restaurant twice while in town recently. Baja had the best breakfast food I've had in a long time.\n I got a specialty pancake meal. I chose chocolate chip for the pancake. It was huge, fluffy and cooked perfectly.  I usually hesitate to get chocolate chip because it can be too rich. This wasn't the case at all. It was so good! The bacon was crisp without any fat on it and the hashbrowns had a nice crunchy crust.\n Overall the food was amazing!  The great yelp reviews didn't let me down.",

        review: "Great no-frills diner-like restaurant with lots of character. Seems to be a popular staple for vets.\n Excellent service, with lots of breakfast and lunch options. I opted for the Reuben (corned beef and sauerkraut) omelette and husband got the huevos rancheros. The food came out quickly, hot, and was delicious. I even had leftovers - yay lunch!",

        review: "This was the first restaurant my family and I went to upon getting to Tucson for a family trip and we did not regret it.\n We waited in a short line, ordered at the window, and were seated at an outside table with a heater as it was a bit chilly outside. Our food was delivered quickly. We devoured the nachos grande and various tacos grandes platters which were all super flavorful.\n Would recommend for a casual and delicious bite to eat!",
